# GitHub + Boards Connection sample
Sample code for using connection APIs to connection GitHub Repos to Azure Boards.

## Getting started

1) Ensure your account is enabled with the private preview feature flag. [Create an issue](https://github.com/danhellem/github-boards-connection-sample/issues) to request access.
2) Follow the instructions in the documentation provided when enrolled in the preview.
3) Sample code is in C# and we recommend using Visual Studio

## Notes

- This is sample code on preview API's. 
- Sample code is not production ready and does scale for production. You will need to make adjustments to fit your environment and use case.

  **For example:** You are limited to 200 repos per batch request. The sample code does not check for that.
