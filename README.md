# GitHub + Boards Connection sample
Sample code for using connection APIs to connection GitHub Repos to Azure Boards.

## Getting started

1) Ensure your account is enabled with the private preview feature flag. [Create an issue](https://github.com/danhellem/github-boards-connection-sample/issues) to request access.
2) Follow the instructions in the documentation provided when enrolled in the preview.

## Notes

- This is sample code on preview API's. 
- Code is not production ready and does scale for production. For example: You are limited to 200 repos per batch request and this sample code does not check for that.
